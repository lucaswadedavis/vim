# VIM

It took about an hour to get really comfortable with VIM. I used these awesome resources:

 - [Vim Interactive Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)
 - [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/)
 - The observation (though I can't remember where I read it) that saying VIM has multiple modes is deceptive. VIM is almost all about normal mode; you'll just dip into and out of insert now and then as needed.
